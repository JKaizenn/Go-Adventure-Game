## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates various programming techniques and concepts in Go, with a focus on modularity, file management, and gameplay logic. It's designed to be both a learning tool and a fun, expandable game.

### **Key Features**
- Explore locations and interact with the game world.
- Take items, view your inventory, and move between locations.
- Dynamically load game data from JSON files for easy customization.

## **Concepts Demonstrated**

This project highlights several essential Go programming concepts:
- **Maps**: Used for efficient location lookups and navigation between connected locations.
- **File Decoding**: Game data is read and parsed from a JSON file for dynamic content loading.
- **Loops**: Core game logic is implemented using loops to handle user input and maintain the game state.
- **Structs and Methods**: Encapsulation of game entities such as `Player` and `Location` for better organization and scalability.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of user input errors and file operations.
- **Modularity**: Organized code across multiple files for maintainability and clarity.

## **What I Learned From This Project**
- Designing and implementing terminal-based user interactions.
- Parsing and using external files (e.g., JSON) to drive program logic.
- Managing program state with Go structs and maps.
- Writing modular and maintainable code in Go.
- Handling errors effectively to ensure a smooth user experience.
